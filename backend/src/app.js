/**
 * The Express application.
 *
 * This file was unparseable on `main` between #539 and #792. Two separate
 * events put it there, and the second is the reason it is worth a comment:
 *
 *   - #539 added the Apollo requires twice — once at the top of the file and
 *     once in the middle of the middleware stack — and then called
 *     `await apolloServer.start()` at module scope. `backend` is CommonJS, so
 *     top-level `await` is a syntax error whatever else is going on.
 *
 *   - #785's "Merge branch 'main' into feature/soft-delete-759" resolved a
 *     whitespace-only conflict by keeping *both* sides, so the file ended up
 *     with two complete copies of the require block, the middleware stack and
 *     the route table.
 *
 * The two copies of the route table were not identical, which is the part that
 * bites quietly: the first mounted `/api/archive` and not `/api/notifications`,
 * the second the other way round, and Express serves whichever match it reaches
 * first. Neither mounted `/api/expenses`. The mount list below is the union, and
 * `__tests__/app.routeMounting.test.js` now asserts it so a future merge cannot
 * drop a router without a test going red.

// Security headers (#896).
//
// `helmet` has been in this file's require block, and in package.json, since
// before #792 — and was never called. Not once. So the API shipped with no
// CSP, no `nosniff`, no `Referrer-Policy`, no frame protection and no HSTS,
// while the comment above the dashboard mount below describes "no security
// headers" as the bug #663 fixed. The mount was moved under the middleware
// stack; the headers were never put into the stack.
//
// Two directives are set explicitly rather than left at their defaults, because
// the defaults are wrong for this particular server:
//
//   - The CSP default is tuned for a server that returns HTML. This one returns
//     JSON to a separate frontend origin, so nothing it serves should ever load
//     a script, a style or a frame. `default-src 'none'` says exactly that, and
//     `frame-ancestors 'none'` is what actually stops an authenticated response
//     being framed — `X-Frame-Options` is the legacy half of the same idea and
//     Helmet still sends it.
//
//   - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` defaults to `same-origin` in Helmet 8,
//     which would block the frontend on :5173 from reading responses from the
//     API on :5000 *even though* the CORS config below allows the origin. The

// logger, CORS, the JSON body parser, the rate limiter and `requireBody` — and
// again down here. Express serves the first mount that matches, so the copy
// that won was the one with no middleware in front of it. Dashboard traffic got
// no security headers, no origin check, no rate limit and no access log, and
// `POST /api/dashboard/layout` threw a TypeError destructuring an unparsed
// `req.body` on every call.
//
// Worth noting what #663 could and could not fix: moving the mount below the
// stack is only worth something if the stack contains what the comment claims.

app.use('/api/dashboard', dashboardRoutes);
// #1877. The router owns `/rules`, `/age-records`, `/register`, `/findings` and

// compliance provision by the first report that read it.

// ─── Feature routers that were never mounted (#1009) ───────────────────────
//
// Eleven of them, each shipped complete — router, controller, models, utils,
// and in most cases a frontend page calling it — and never added to this table.
// This is the fifth time: #614 (workflows), #474 (webhooks), #954
// (integrations), #509 (monthly updates) and #719 (expenses) are all the same
// omission, and all documented above. `app.routeMounting.test.js` now derives
// its expectations by walking `routes/` instead of from a hand-written list, so
// the next router to arrive without a mount fails CI rather than going quiet
// for a few months.
//
// The paths are not a free choice. Each router defines its own sub-paths and
// the frontend pages already call specific URLs, so the mount is whatever makes
// the two line up. Most are unsurprising; the two that are not are called out.

app.use('/api/assets', assetRoutes);

// #1971. The router owns `/rules`, `/status`, `/certificates`,

// reason attached rather than a bare no — that ground reaches a domestic member
// and not this one.
app.use('/api/international-workers', internationalWorkerRoutes);

// #1972. The router owns `/rules`, `/registrations`, `/particulars`,
// `/closures`, `/expiring` and `/position`. It reports a lapsed certificate as
// operating unregistered rather than as a renewal overdue, and it returns the
// weekly holiday as two verdicts rather than one — the establishment's notified
// closing day and the employee's entitlement to a whole day off are separate
// obligations, and a single answer answers whichever one the reader was not
// asking about.
app.use('/api/establishments', shopsEstablishmentsRoutes);

// and it will not commit a claim with no payee resolved.
app.use('/api/edli', edliRoutes);

app.use('/api/contract-labour', contractLabourRoutes);

// #1771. Its own prefix rather than a sub-path of `/api/contract-labour`, for

// `/apprentices` and `/assessments`.
app.use('/api/apprenticeships', apprenticeshipRoutes);

// #1826. Its own prefix rather than a sub-path of `/api/contract-labour`: the

app.use('/api/migrant-workmen', migrantWorkmenRoutes);

// #2029. The router owns `/rules`, `/queue`, `/establishments`,

// sub-paths. It reports an uncertified establishment as governed by the Model
// Standing Orders rather than by nothing — section 12A deems them adopted, and
// 'no standing orders' is wrong in the direction that matters — and it returns
// a modification inside the six-month bar as BARRED_UNILATERALLY, because the

app.use('/api/standing-orders', standingOrdersRoutes);

app.use('/api/tax-proofs', taxProofRoutes);

// #2031. The router owns `/rules`, `/queue`, `/nominations`, `/claims`,
// `/claims/:id` and the notices, forfeiture and payment sub-paths. It does not
// recompute the amount — `settlement.js` keeps the five-year gate, the 15/26
// formula and the ceiling — and it reports the section 7(3A) interest whether
// or not anybody asked, because it accrues at a statutory rate from a date the
