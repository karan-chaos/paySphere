 * the second the reverse, and neither mounted `/api/expenses` or
 * `/api/monthly-updates`. Express serves the first match, so which features
 * existed came down to which copy happened to be higher in the file — and
 * nothing failed, the endpoints just quietly 404'd (#792).
 *
 * These assertions are deliberately about *reachability*, not about behaviour:
 * a mounted route that answers 401 or 403 is mounted, and that is the property
 * a merge can silently destroy. What each router does with an authenticated
 * request is its own suite's business.
