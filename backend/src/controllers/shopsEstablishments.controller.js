/**
 * @fileoverview Shops and Commercial Establishments Acts (#1972).
 *
 * Three decisions carry this controller.
 *
 * **It raises the headcount amendment from the employee count itself.** The
 * band sits on the certificate, `employee.controller.js` changes it with an
 * ordinary hire, and nothing connects the two. `syncHeadcount` reads the
 * establishment's current count, resolves the band, and — where it differs from
 * the band on the certificate — records the divergence **dated from when it
 * arose** rather than from now. Dating it from now would turn a change made in
 * March into a deadline in June.
 *
 * **It reports a lapsed certificate as trading unregistered, not as a renewal
 * that is late.** They are different findings with different consequences, and a
 * queue showing them as one row lets the serious one be cleared alongside the
 * trivial one. The two never share a code.
 *
 * **It owns nothing in the roster.** It reads shifts to evaluate the weekly
 * holiday and the notified hours, and reports where a shift is rostered against
 * a day the establishment is closed. It does not move the shift — the Act makes
 * that a compliance question for the employer rather than a scheduling error for
 * the product to correct.
 *
 * Everything that decides a window, a cycle or a band is in
 * `utils/shopsEstablishments.js`.
