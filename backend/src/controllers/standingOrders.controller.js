/**
 * @fileoverview Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (#2029).
 *
 * Four decisions carry this controller.
 *
 * **It raises applicability from the headcount itself.** `syncHeadcount` reads
 * the establishment's strength, appends it to the history, and — where it is the
 * first crossing of the state's threshold — writes `applicableFrom` **dated from
 * that day**. The six-month clock starts on an ordinary hire that
 * `employee.controller.js` makes without knowing it has started anything, and
 * dating it from now would turn six months that have been running since March
 * into six months starting today.
 *
 * **It never unsets `applicableFrom`.** The proviso to section 1(3) keeps the
 * Act applying however far strength later falls, so the write is one-way. This
 * is the single line in the module that a well-meaning "recompute from current
 * state" refactor would break, and it is why applicability is stored rather than
 * derived on read.
 *
 * **It reports the Model Standing Orders as governing, never "none".** Section
 * 12A means an uncertified establishment is bound by a real set of terms it has
 * probably not read, and a screen saying "no standing orders" is wrong in the
 * direction that matters. `getPosition` and the queue both return an instrument
 * for every applicable establishment.
 *
 * **It records the dispatch date, not the certificate date.** `recordCertification`
 * takes `authenticatedCopiesSentOn` under section 5(3) and refuses to compute an
 * operation date without it. `certifiedOn` is stored and deliberately not used
 * for the section 7 arithmetic — it is routinely weeks earlier, and using it
 * would bring the orders into force before they bind anybody.
 *
 * Everything that decides a threshold, a window or an instrument is in
 * `utils/standingOrders.js`.
