/**
 * @fileoverview Section 10A of the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act,
 * 1946 (#1828).
 *
 * The controller has two rules it holds to.
 *
 * **The attributability finding is recorded, never inferred.** It would be easy
 * to conclude that an enquiry which has run two hundred days without a hearing
 * was delayed by the employer, and to uplift on that basis. The module does not:
 * the uplift is conditional on a finding, and a finding is somebody's judgement
 * about whose conduct caused the delay. `recordAttributability` therefore takes
 * a reason and stamps who made it, and the rate is a *consequence* of that
 * record rather than something an operator can set. Making the rate editable
 * would let the stored number stop saying whether a finding was made — which is
 * the one thing an enquiry record has to evidence.
 *
 * **The wage base is frozen when the suspension is created.** It is copied from
 * the employee's salary at that moment and never re-read. Section 10A is on the
 * wages the workman was entitled to *immediately preceding* the suspension, and
 * pointing at the live salary would let a grade revision two years into a
 * suspension silently restate every month already paid.
 *
 * One thing the controller deliberately does not know: what the enquiry is
 * about. A suspension pending a POSH enquiry attracts section 10A exactly as
 * any other does, and the committee's proceedings are confidential to it — so
 * this module takes a suspension and a finding as inputs and stores a one-line
 * ground for identification, not an allegation.
 *
 * Everything that decides a rate, a tier or a set-off is in
 * `utils/subsistenceAllowance.js`.
