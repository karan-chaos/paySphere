/**
 * @fileoverview Payment of Wages Act, 1936 (#1767).
 *
 * The controller's real job is assembly, and it is harder than it looks,
 * because the deduction set the engine needs does not exist anywhere as a set.
 *
 * `payroll.model.js` carries `deductions` as a single scalar, `customDeductions`
 * as an array of names and amounts, `leaveDeduction` as its own column and
 * `loanRecoveries` as a third shape entirely. Four representations, written by
 * four engines that never had to agree with each other, and section 7(3) is a
 * rule about their sum — so the first thing this does is flatten them into one
 * list with a section 7(2) clause attached to each row.
 *
 * The flattening is where the classification has to be conservative. A row that
 * cannot be placed in a clause is reported as an unauthorised deduction, which
 * is a breach, so guessing generously would hide the exact thing the module
 * exists to find. `classifyDeduction` therefore falls to UNAUTHORISED rather
 * than to a plausible clause, and this file gives it the best labels it can
 * instead of widening the guess.
 *
 * Everything that decides whether a deduction is lawful is in
 * `utils/paymentOfWages.js`.
