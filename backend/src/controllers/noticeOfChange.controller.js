/**
 * @fileoverview Industrial Disputes Act section 9A — notice of change (#1973).
 *
 * Four decisions carry this controller.
 *
 * **It observes and never blocks.** Nothing here refuses a salary revision, a
 * roster change or a benefits change. Section 9A creates a notice obligation
 * with a section 31 penal consequence; it does not make the change void, and a
 * controller that returned 409 on a short notice would be asserting a remedy the
 * Act does not give. Every response is a position, not a permission.
 *
 * **It freezes the determination onto the notice.** `determinePopulation` writes
 * the capacity and the wages as they were when it ran, because a supervisor on
 * ₹9,800 is a workman and the same supervisor after a raise is not. Recomputing
 * from today's employee records would move people in and out of a population a
 * notice was already served on.
 *
 * **It moves the effective date rather than editing it.** `moveEffectiveDate`
 * appends to `effectiveDateHistory`, because the reason an effective date moves
 * is almost always that the notice came up short — and the original date is the
 * evidence of what the shortfall was.
 *
 * **It reports section 33 as its own answer.** Where a proceeding is pending,
 * `getPosition` and the queue return SECTION_33_PERMISSION_REQUIRED with no
 * notice window attached at all. A screen showing "21 days" against a pending
 * adjudication tells the employer to commit an offence on a date certain.
 *
 * Everything that decides an item, a window or a determination is in
 * `utils/noticeOfChange.js`.
