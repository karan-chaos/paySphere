/**
 * Authenticate a request and resolve the tenant it is scoped to.
 *
 * This file was `auth.middleware.ts` and could not be loaded (#1008).
 *
 * `backend` is CommonJS and `package.json` starts the server with
 * `node src/index.js`. There is no build step in front of that, and no `dist/`
 * was ever produced, so `require('../middlewares/auth.middleware')` had nothing
 * to resolve to — Node does not read `.ts`. Forty-eight modules require this
 * one, effectively every router in the tree, so the first one Express reached
 * threw `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and took the boot down with it. The same syntax also
 * defeated Babel, which is configured with `@babel/preset-env` and no
 * TypeScript preset, so the two suites written against this middleware could
 * not even parse — they reported "failed to run" rather than "failed", which
 * reads like an environment problem instead of a dead server.
 *
 * The annotations are preserved as JSDoc rather than discarded. Nothing in the
 * repo type-checks on CI, so they were documentation already; this way they
 * stay readable to an editor without requiring a toolchain the project does not
 * have.

/**
 * The tenant a request belongs to.
 *
 * Order matters and is the subject of #612. #585 read the claim straight off
 * the JWT; refresh tokens live seven days, so a session opened before the
 * account had a tenant carried `tenantId: undefined` for a week afterwards. An
 * undefined tenant is not a filter that matches nothing — mongoose drops the
 * key before the driver sees it, which turns every scoped read into an
 * unscoped one.
 *
 * So: the account row wins, because it is current. The claim is only a
 * fallback, and only when it is actually usable — `"undefined"` is what
 * interpolating a missing id into a template produces and it must never become
 * a filter value. Provisioning is last, and is not reached at all for an
 * account that is already scoped, because this runs on every authenticated
 * request and must not cost a write.
 *
 * Returning `null` rather than throwing is deliberate: 401 here would log
 * people out of endpoints that are not tenant-scoped at all, such as reading
 * their own settings. The refusal belongs at the scoped query, which is what
 * `utils/tenantScope.js` does.
