     * The company the action happened in — the field the read endpoints filter
     * on.
     *
     * Added in #664. Before it, `AuditLog` had no tenant at all and
     * `audit.controller.js` filtered on `userId: req.userId`, so the trail was a
     * personal diary: an owner reviewing who approved a payroll run saw only the
     * runs they approved themselves, and every action by the other admins and HR
     * managers in the same company was invisible to them. #458 deliberately split
     * approve from write so two different people are involved in a payroll run —
     * and then neither could see the other's half of it.
     *
     * Required. There is no such thing as an audit entry that belongs to no
     * company, and a nullable tenant on a scoped collection is how you end up
     * with `{ tenantId: undefined }` silently matching everything — see
     * utils/tenantScope.js.
